## Design


### Colour Scheme

The following colours were generated from the [Battle City Spritsheet](assets/battle_city_spritesheet.png) using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). We chose a selection of neutral, muted and strong colours. They accent the gaming environment with an array of contrasts available.

![Battle City Muted Colour Palette](docs/design/battle_city_muted.png)
![Battle City Strong Colour Palette](docs/design/battle_city_strong.png)


### Typography

![Battle City Font](docs/fonts/battle_city_font.PNG)
The [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P?preview.text=Welcome%20to%20Battle%20City&query=Press+Start+2P) font adds to the pixelated theme of the game. It adds some fun, and evokes a feeling of nostalgia. It is illustrative, yet has a structural integrity and readability to it. The user can get a clear sense of the design from this font.
